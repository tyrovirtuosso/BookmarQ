My tech stack from 2000 looks very different from the one 2023. But there is still a lot that remains the same.

Security will remain hot. It is a very different world than the one of the office worms and scams of the 20th century.

On AI, not so much on developing them, but more adapting them for everyday use. Understanding how to use them to make you more productive will be key for the next decade. If they can fully augment you, that's a sweet spot.

With globalism taking a back seat and manufacturing coming back to the US, it is a good field to understand. More specifically, supply chain and manufacturing execution. </a> </li>

To me it means deploying to a remote machine through some kind of interface, making it also accessible remotely to other users (basically abstracting away the physical infrastructure).

For example Microsoft has Azure Stack, which allows you to basically run Azure on your own infrastructure. Setting that up is up to the infrastructure team, but for the developer it’s largely the same.

I would certainly put it down as knowledge of “Azure Cloud” on my CV even though the actual infrastructure was running on premises. </a> </li>
